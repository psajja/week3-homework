Towards the north of Charminar is the Char Kaman, or four gateways, constructed in the cardinal directions.[7][13] [15] Mir Momin Astarabadi, Qutb Shah's prime minister, played a leading role in preparing the layout plan for the Charminar along with that of the new capital city, Hyderabad.[16]:170 Additional eminent architects from Persia were also invited to develop the city plan. The structure itself was intended to serve as a Mosque and Madraasa. It is of Indo-Islamic architecture style, incorporating Persian architectural elements.", "id"=>"35"}
